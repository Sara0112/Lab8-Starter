Graceful degradation and service workers are connected because they help improve user experience. We start with a full application that needs a fast network, then add service workers to store responses. This way, pages load quickly and handle network requests separately, which is helpful for users with slow or no internet. After the first visit, data is cached, so next time, users might not get the full experience but will still have a usable version of the page, avoiding long waits.
